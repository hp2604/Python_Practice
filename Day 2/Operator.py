print("Multiple of Two number is",x*y)

print("Division of two number is",x/y)

print("Integer Division of Two Number is ",x//y)

print("Remainder of Two number is ", x%y);


# Assignment Operator
x+=2;
print(x);
x-=2;
print(x);
x/=2
print(x);
x*=2
print(x);
x%=2;
print(x);
x//=2;
print(x);

a,b=5,10;
print(a);
print(b);

#Unary Operator
x=-x;
print(x);

# Logical Operator

# equals
print(a==b);

# less than
print(a<b);

# Greater than
print(a>b);

# Not Equal
print(a!=b);

# Relational Operator 

# AND
print( a<b and a<10);

# OR 
print(a<b or a<10);

#Not 
print(not a);
